# Titanic Data Analysis

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook (`TitanicSS.ipynb`) for analyzing and visualizing the Titanic dataset. The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to better understand key features of the dataset.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and preprocesses the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Examines survival rates and relationships between features like HomePlanet, Destination, Cabin etc.
- **Visualizations**: Generates insightful plots, including boxplots comparing numerical features based on survival status.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are used:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn` (optional, if modeling is included)

Additionally, the project requires **Python 3.13.0**. Ensure you have this version installed.

To install the required packages, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
